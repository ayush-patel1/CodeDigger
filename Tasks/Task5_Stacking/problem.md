                                                                  Merry's Stacking
Merry is engaged in a fascinating game involving 
 N stacks(1 <= N <= 1,000,000, N odd), initially all empty and numbered from 1 to N.Alice provides Merry with 
K instructions (1≤𝐾≤25,000). Each instruction is in the format "A B," which directs Merry to add one block to the top of every stack from 𝐴 to B (inclusive). For example, if Alice says "10 13," Merry will add one block to stacks 10, 11, 12, and 13.

Once all instructions are executed, Alice wants to determine the median height of the 𝑁 stacks. The median height is defined as the height of the middle stack if all stacks were sorted in ascending order by their heights. Since N is guaranteed to be odd, the median is unique.

Your task is to help Merry compute the median height of her stacks efficiently.

INPUT FORMAT:

Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N K.

Lines 2..1+K: Each line contains one of Alice's instructions in the form of two space-separated integers A B (1 <= A <= B <= N).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The median height of a stack after Merry completes the instructions.
